# [Unsupervised Learning of quantum system's phases](https://github.com/mabrur-bing/Diffusion-Maps-Classical-Shadows)
 Classical shadows are approximate descriptions of quantum states obtained by few measurements. We showed that diffusion map, a kernel-based unsupervised learning method, can be a powerful tool in learning features of a quantum system from classical shadows.

# [Equilibrium And Non-equilibrium Monte Carlo to simulate super-ionic conductor](https://github.com/mabrur-bing/Li-ion-Hopping)
How is the thermal conductivity of a solid-state electrolyte material affected by its thermal properties? We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo for thermal sampling and Kinetic Monte Carlo to sample ion conduction dynamics to answer this.
