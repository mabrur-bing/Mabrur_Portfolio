My projects in Computational Physics and Machine Learning

# [Unsupervised Learning of Phase Diagram from Quantum Simulation Data](https://github.com/mabrur-bing/Diffusion-Maps-Classical-Shadows)
Classical shadows are approximate descriptions of quantum states obtained by few measurements. We showed that Diffusion Map, a kernel-based unsupervised learning method, can be a powerful tool for learning the features of a quantum system from classical shadows.
  - Diffusion Map
  - quantum simulation data (ground state and dynamics)
  - feature learning and phases identification
  - Multidimensional Scaling

# [Equilibrium And Non-equilibrium Monte Carlo to Simulate Super-Ionic Conductors](https://github.com/mabrur-bing/Li-ion-Hopping)
How is the ionic conductivity of a solid-state electrolyte material affected by its thermal properties? To answer this, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MHMC) for thermal sampling and Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) for stochastic sampling of ion conduction dynamics.
  - Replica Exchange Monte Carlo for calculating thermodynamic quantities
  - Kinetic Monte Carlo for stochastic simulation of time evolution
  - lattice Coulomb gas model

# [Quantum Dynamics of Strongly Correlated Spin System with Qiskit](https://github.com/mabrur-bing/quantum-dynamics)
We demonstrate how to do quantum dynamics simulation for Transverse-Field-Ising-Model (TFIM) using Qiskit.
